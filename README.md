# Data Cleaning & EDA San Fransisco Salaries
Fun project for cleaning and short EDA after cleaning. This data uses [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/sf-salaries).
The data is quite dirty, and a lot of null values.
If the code want to be downloaded and run on local host, it is possible. But in order to run it on local host, the code needs to be adjusted since this notebook is run on Kaggle.

Also some library that are needed to run the notebook on localhost.
1. NumPy -> ``` pip install numpy```
3. Pandas -> ```pip install pandas```
5. Jupyter Notebook -> ```pip install notebook```
6. python-math -> ```pip install python-math```
