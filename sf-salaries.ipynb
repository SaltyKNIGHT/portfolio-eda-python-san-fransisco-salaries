Number 1 and number 2 has a enormous margin of overtime pay, both do not have benefit. Even though both are high ranks one can assume that captain in police department job needs a lot of overtime and even so the payment can't be compare with the first one.\n\n2. Other pay can give a lot of number to salary like for example the first one if compare to captain in police department job, the first one has a lot of other pay and no overtime salary. Which can be assume General Manager-Metropolitan Transit Authority is easier to do than Captain III (Police Department) work. Harder work doesn't necessarily mean higher pay.\n\n3. Number 2 and number 3, Captain III and Deputy Chief 3, Deputy Chief 3 has smaller base pay than Captain III, but Deputy Chief 3 other pay make it up for the smaller base pay while Captain III do not have other pay. Instead Captain III get overtime pay, which again can be assumed that Deputy Chief 3 probably do not have any overtime and that's the explanaton for 0 overtime pay.\n\n4.
